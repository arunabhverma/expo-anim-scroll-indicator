# Custom Scroll Indicator Demo

This project showcases a custom scroll indicator inspired by the Samsung Gallery scroll indicator, designed for both Android and iOS. Built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/), [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/), and [react-native-gesture-handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/), this example highlights how to create an interactive scroll indicator.

## Demo

## Features

- **Pan Gesture Support**: Users can manually adjust the scroll indicator using pan gestures, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Automatic Sync with Scroll**: The indicator automatically syncs with the content scroll, mimicing the native scroll indicator behaviour.
- **Layout Transitions for Chip Width**: Using layout transitions from Reanimated, the width of the indicator chips dynamically adjusts based on content changes, creating a polished feel.

## How It Works

- **Pan Gesture Handling**: The scroll indicator utilizes pan gestures to allow users to slide the indicator manually. The `onTouchStart` and `onTouchEnd` events from the `View` are leveraged to manage the interaction states.
  
- **Automatic Sliding**: As the user scrolls through content, the indicator starts sliding automatically, which is calculated based on the scroll offset.

- **Chip Transition**: The chips that showing content have layout transition it makes their width increased or decreased depending on their content size, giving a satisfying responsive feel to the user.

- **Calculated Content**: The calculated content simplifies the implementation process, allowing for straightforward adjustments.
